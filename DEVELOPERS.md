## Developing frost

### Development Setup
We use [Stack|https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/] for development.
Simply cloning the repo and running `stack test` should be enough to start hacking on the project.

### Known problems
Stack installed via `nix-env` is known to cause problems while building.
